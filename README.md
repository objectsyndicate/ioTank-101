Arduino 101 environment monitor.


# What does it do?

It uses cheap off the shelf sensors and hardware to monitor light quality for indoor agriculture in a handheld and bluetooth package.

It does this by detecting particular wavelenghts and providing feedback, as well as soil humidity and temperature.
