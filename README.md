# ioTank-101
Arduino 101 environment monitor.


# What does it do?

It uses affordable, off the shelf, sensors and hardware to monitor light quality and other metrics for indoor agriculture in a handheld and bluetooth package.

It does this by detecting particular wavelenghts of light, as well as soil humidity and temperature.

These are critical in photosynthesis,

But almost impossible to detect with the naked eye.

ioTank-101 is now among the eco-system of open source agriculture solutions Object Syndicate provides to the masses!
